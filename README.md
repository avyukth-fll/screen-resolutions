# screen-resolutions
This repo is my hacktober fest learning ground to learn about HTML, JS and various screen resolution types. Based on the window and screen resolution, it even prints out the landscape/portrait/square orientation of the window.

# See this in action
I've published this app at this [demo page](https://k-a-rthik.github.io/screen-resolutions/) on GitHub Pages for quick verification and checking of your own screen resolution. 

# Check-out the repo
